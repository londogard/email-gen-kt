###         Innovation Day Collaboration - Realtime Pair-Programming

To be able to make the best of a virtual event it's important to have the right tools. Therefore I recommend these two editors for real-time collaboration and Pair-Programming like you'd be together.

All **[Jetbrains IDEA ](https://www.jetbrains.com/)** ([IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download), [WebStorm ](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download)etc)
Includes a real-time collaboration tool for coding called [Code With Me](https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/) which also includes a audio/video chat if needed.

**Visual Studio Code** ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) which with the plugin system supports most programming languages.
Includes a real-time collaboration tool for coding called [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)

### [AFRY]  GitHub Pages + Progressive Web App (PWA) = ❤️

>**Disclaimer:** Don't do this for commercial products.

Do you know what a **P**rogressive **W**eb **A**pp (PWA) is? In short it's a web-page which is created to work like an app when you open it in a web-page, you can even install it on your Android / Windows / iOS System.   

In this blog the (few) requirements for a PWA are shown and how to make this work together with _GitHub Pages_ to have a free, smooth & simple deployment process of your PWA.

### 🔀 Light Pollution Map

### 📱 Learn CSS

CSS is something a lot of people just learn the basics, but there's so much that is just there for you to grab. Small, simple utils which will make your life a lot easier. Make sure to take a look at this superb (!) resource!

### 📱 Material You - Material Design 2.0

At Google I/O (2021) Google unveiled Material You, a radical new way to think about design. Material You will transform design for Android, for Google, and for the entire tech industry. Over the coming months, Google plan to share more details about Material You, and how it is shaping everything we do at Google.

### 🎒 PUMP UP THE JAM(-stack)! Incremental Static Regeneration

There are a lot of opinions out there about how to improve and scale sites “beyond the Jamstack” by adding in features that use a Node server in addition to the pre-built pages. One of those features is called Incremental Static Regeneration. Some people call it “hybrid web development” (or “hybrid serverless + static”) but let’s talk a bit more about what that means.

### [AFRY]  Codewars: Achieve mastery through challenge

Frank Camara recommends Codewars, a place to improve your code skills which quickly becomes addictive!

### 🎒 Appwrite - Open-Source End-to-End Backend Server

Leaving Google behind has become a tiny bit of a trend - and it's a good one. Firebase is an incredibly used tool from Google which allows you to sync multiple things relevant for Apps and WebApps. With Appwrite you can finally leave Google behind for your open-source project that still wants that "awesome syncing".   

Appwrite is a DB, Storage, Authentication, GPS, ... you name it - just as Firebase.

Got another tool? Share it with us!

### 📈 LaMDA - A bad name by Google for their great GPT-3 contender

I won't head into a discussion about why the name is really, and yes I mean really, bad but LaMDA is a very impressive piece and I can't wait to see more about it. 

Do you want to discuss more about how it might work behind the scenes? Join the ML-slack channel and the discussions! 😄
