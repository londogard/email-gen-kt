### 🔀 Android 13 virtualization lets Android run Windows 11

Windows now runs Android, Google said "Hold my beer" and made Android run Windows 11!  
Previously it was possible to run Linux through `termux` (awesome app, and btw I run Arch) but with Android 13 Google enabled virtualization.  
This change was most likely not done to enable this kind of OS-virtualization but rather to improve security, but I'll take the side-effect!

Excerpt:

> As far as I can tell, we can pretty much get full EL2 on production devices now. Protected KVM is optional and can be enabled on a per-VM basis, but for non-protected VMs, it looks like full KVM functionality is available.

### 👥 Psychological safety is critical for high-performing teams

Does your team celebrate success stories, failure or both?  
If not you should!

To embrace risks, failures and shots in the dark is not only something I myself believe required to move forward but also psychology and risk management stands behind this. That is theoretical approaches also propose the same.

To allow failures means to allow new ways of thinking, being brave, and finding future paths.  
To not allow failures lead to a culture of silence, which will be a house of cards ready to fall any second. Like a domino brick pushed, donezo.

Stack Overflows blog goes deeper into this and how to build a space of reflection, safety and to be the best.

> An introduction to psychological safety and ways to evaluate the level of safety in your organization.

### 🔀 How do Mac's get on the network so fast?

Following last weeks great program recommendation to shut that pesky Bluetooth down on Macs that's are sleeping our very own Fredrik Strandin shared a very interesting story.

It seems Apple has used similar behaviour to quickly connect to network, which might end up in chaos on large networks 🤯

### 🔀 Google is bringing Chrome OS to PCs and Macs

Chrome OS Flex is a new version of Chrome OS designed to run on PCs and Macs. It is designed for businesses and schools and can be installed within minutes. The OS looks and feels identical to Chrome OS on a Chromebook, but some features may be dependent on the hardware that it is running on. Chrome OS Flex is still in early access mode. It can be booted from a USB drive without being installed
