###         Implicit vs Scala 3's Given

Fredrik Strandin hits right home with this recommendation. This is a blog by Alexandru which walks through the new concept of `Given` in Scala 3, which Alexandru does not approve of, that tries to be an alternative to `implicit` (oh have I fighted you dear `implicit`).

>Idon‚Äôt like given, as an alternative to implicit in Scala 3. The more I try working with it, the more it annoys me; and my understanding may be superficial, but I don‚Äôt like this direction. Here‚Äôs a comparison between given and implicit, that I hope is fair‚Ä¶

### üéí What I learnt from Benchmarking Http4k, Ktor (Kotlin) and Actix v2,v3 (Rust) Microservices

Who doesn't enjoy a good benchmarking blog? Especially with the 'hard to benchmark' JVM! This blog is written in a enjoyable way and is very interesting to learn about different characteristics between JVM/Rust.  
All in all I'm interested in trying Http4k which is a functional backend using functions only. **Anyone else wanna team up a Competence Evening to test it out?**

### üîÄ Matplotlib Mosaic - Multigraphs simplified

Ever felt like plotting mulitple plots in Python being a pain? I'm with you.  
Using `plt.subplot_mosaic(..)` one can simply achieve really cool plots as in the image below üëá.

### üîÄ PartialExecutor: Reducing WebAssembly size byty exploring all executions in LLVM

A bit heavy, but really cool!

>
Partial Executer is a brand-new LLVM optimization pass that uses an Interpreter-like engine to prove some code will never be executed, making it safe to eliminate it.

>In this article, I will explain the ideas behind it, the engineering challenges, and the results of this work.
