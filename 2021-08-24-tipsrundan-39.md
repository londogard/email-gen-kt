###         exercism - practice code or mentoring anyone!

Björn Pedersen warmly recommends you to sign up for [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) and either practice your coding or reviewing someone else. He do (or don't) promise you'll have a great time and learn a thing or two!

P.S. it's also great to learn a new language this way!

### 🎒 Litements - SQLite extensions that makes sense

Some of us use SQLite extensively, and those who don't might just miss out on something.

Litements is components built on top of SQLite which includes:
 - a [queue](https://litements.exampl.io/queue/) that allows you to create a persistent queue
 - [dictionary](https://litements.exampl.io/dictionary/) that allows you to have a persisten key-value store
 - [counter](https://litements.exampl.io/counter/) which gives you a persistent counter

### 📈 Text Classification through Data Compression 🤪

A few of us know that Language Models used for Text in AI/ML is a way to compress knowledge.
  A few more of us knows that Data Compression that's great knows a bit about the statistical distribution of the data to compress it more efficiently.

💡 What if we used _compression_ as a language model? The [LZW algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch) actually models a maximum-entropy probability distribution. Read the following blog to learn exactly how it's done!

### 🔀 The small web is beautiful

A good, well-written blog.

>I believe that small websites are compelling aesthetically, but are also important to help us resist selling our souls to large tech companies. In this essay I present a vision for the “small web” as well as the small software and architectures that power it. Also, a bonus rant about microservices.
