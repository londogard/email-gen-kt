### 🎒 GraalVM tips n' tricks

James Ward shows some cool tricks for optimizing GraalVM.  
For those that don't know what GraalVM is.  
> GraalVM is an optimizing compiler that generates smarter code. Including Ahead-of-Time (AoT) Compile to native binaries allow **instant boot, peak performance** with **no warmup time**.  

This guide includes clever flags to use, how to solve reflection issues (as reflection is _runtime_).  
James ended up with a small & fast image to use in production based on these premises! 🥳

### 📈 Zillow to stop flipping home as it stands to lose > $550 million (Machine Learning failure)

For those that missed this news I'll give you a few seconds to laugh or smug.  
One of the first public huge failures of a machine learning algorithm. In summary they are set to loose up towards $550 million and have to lay off 25% of the staff.  
Predicting house prices 6 months in advance is a really tough problem which requires non-automatic system, which most likely was applied by Zillow. Trusting yourself too much, especially in times as covid, might hit back. Real hard.

### 📱 React 18 in Beta!

React 18 is finally entering beta-stage after being alpha for a while. One of the cooler hooks added is `useSyncExternalStore`. Another interesting feature is batching stuffs before rendering.  
[List](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html) of some features.

### 🔀 CloudFlare Pages goes Full-Stack

JAM-Stack to Full-stack. Essentially CloudFlare Pages now allows you to simply use their cloudworkers through adding files with functions in `./functions`, e.g.  
```js  
// GET requests to /filename would return "Hello, world!"  
export const onRequestGet = () => {  
  return new Response("Hello, world!")  
}  
```  
CloudFlare has a pretty cool free package, so for you all your private projects this is very exciting!

### 🔀 Story time: How I helped build a profitable MVP over a weekend

I think this story is more telling than one would guess. It's about how you can take a step back, deliver something which really might not be up to your standards but does fit the bill and include simply the **necessary** logic and functionality.

### 🔀 Prettymaps - Rendering your map cool

Did you know that it's now possible to simply draw your village, neighbourhood or whatever on a map in a very stylistic sense? `prettymaps` by marceloprates gives this functionality and it looks great! Perfect for a painting at home or some cool story-telling map.

### 🔀 LMGrep - For all you terminal freaks

TL;DR  
> What if `grep` supported the functionality of a proper search engine like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) without a need to install any servers or index the files before searching? [`lmgrep`](https://github.com/dainiusjocas/lucene-grep) aims to provide you just that. It is installed as just one executable file without any dependencies, provides a command-line interface, starts-up instantly, and works on macOS, Linux, and, yes, even Windows.
> 
> See the source code [here](https://github.com/dainiusjocas/lucene-grep).  

In short `lmgrep` includes fancy stuffs like stemming, tokenization and much more to reduce the need of using a lot of regexps while grepping. For full-text search `lmgrep` will most likely be very helpful for you!  
The blog is indeed very interesting and 100% worth the read!
