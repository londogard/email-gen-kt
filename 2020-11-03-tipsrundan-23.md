## Godisboxen 🍭
        
###  Competence Evenings

Throughout the previous week we killed zombies using a coded bot (#competence_algorithms_problem_solving) and discussed how to actually write good, clean code (#bokcirkel). If you're interested to broaden your knowledge and learn more make sure to join in or ask around in #bu_competence on Slack!

### 🔀 pbcopy - your friend

Hannes Sandberg shared the tool 'pbcopy' which helps you copy data in the terminal into the clipboard. Example: `curl wttr.in/Malmö | pbcopy`. Really simple to use and very helpful!



### 🔀 Small tech - Small companies that does their thing and keeps being awesome [short]

A inspiring read, I love to hear about deeply focused people/teams/companies that do their one thing really well! Excerpt: '...I made a list of small companies that I admire. Neither giants nor startups - just people making a living writing software on their own terms.'
