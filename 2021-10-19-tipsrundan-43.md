## Godisboxen 🍭
        
### 🔀 Syncthing - Syncing differently

Open (Source|Protocol|Development) and private continuous file synchronization made simple. Personally I use Syncthing to sync my markdown notes and it works very well.  
If you wish to make it more complex you can add 1-way sync or bidirectional. Add custom filters and much more!

### 🔀 Hackers Unite - The first iPhone with USB C

Kenny Pi is pretty famous in the hardware hacking circles. In this video he showcase the iPhone he modified to use USB-C. Have you ever hacked/modded hardware like this? Make sure to share on Slack ([#technical_discussions](https://buitsouth.slack.com/archives/C019L2218Q6))

### 🔀 Bryan keep making things out of checkboxes

This might just be one of the most random things I've included this far. Imagine combining a visual computer lab from school with checkboxes. Then imagine doing that now. That's essentially what we have, some really fun ways to visualize and interact with checkboxes (creating graphics!).
