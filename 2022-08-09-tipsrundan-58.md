### 🔀 Prune Once for All: Sparse Pre-Trained Language Models

Sparsity was once the name of the game. Old Natural Language Technology (NLP) techniques built upon very sparse data structures like Bag of Words, TF-IDF and others. Deep Learning turned this upside down by using dense structures to represent the intent/meaning rather than exact word. Even if the end-result is dense the path to the output is often not dense, as such this paper proposes a Sparsely trained Neural Network.

### 🔀 tolower() in bulk at speed

Optimizing simpel functions might seem like a stupid thing, but it can achieve two "important things":

1. Incredibly fun and challenging
2. Achieve incredible speedups as the function might be used pretty much everywhere

> Here’s a fun bit of Monday optimization.  
> DNS servers often have to convert DNS names to their canonical lower case form. BIND has to do so a bit more than most because it tries to preserve the case of DNS names rather than canonicalizing them.

### 🔀 Transformers for software engineers

Still only know Transformers as the electrical engineering thingy?  
It's time to dust of the old books and get to know Transformers as the Deep Learning model that has impacted the world around us.

This blog is really fun and takes a interesting path to explain transformers in the way of Software Engineering rather than Data Science!

### 🔀 How are Unix pipes implemented?

I bet you've used pipes in Linux, and I bet 99.9 % of you don't know the internals. I also bet that only 1 or 2 of you out there is actually interested, but here you go! This is for you!
