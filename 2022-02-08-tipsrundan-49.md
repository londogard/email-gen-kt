### 🔀 Feeling Inspired? - Ask HN: Programming talks that made something click for you? 

Hacker News, the place to be, had a great discussion thread about the programming talks that made something click.  
The moment something clicks is almost a bit philosphical to me, sometimes things clicks that didn't before - why? Is it based on the current context of life and experiences? Is it that someone simply explains something the right way? What do you think? Post on Slack to create a discussion!

### 🔀 MacBook + Bluetooth + Sleeping mode = steals my headphones

Anyone else that is annoyed about your bluetooth headphones or even speakers being connected to the sleeping MacBook?

I for one was. I could not force my smartphone to be the connected party, unless I walked 30 meters away. One day I finally google'd and found the answer... 'BlueSnooze'!  
Simply install this program and it'll handle it for you. Back to the music 🎧

### 🔀 Building a modern home in the forest

A few out there are currently looking at building or buying houses. In this blog you'll not only get inspired but perhaps also a bit in awe.

A beautiful home in a inspiring location (although lonely perhaps).
