## Godisboxen 🍭
        
### 🎒 Smart Open (Python)

Have you ever dreamt of opening a file independent of its type with the same method? Without thinking? I have, and I bet some of you have! I discovered this library when I was working on something using gensim (will be in another Tipsrundan) and I was amazed. RaRe-Technologies has created a pythonic interface where they override 'open' using their own and instead lets you open gzip, bz, s3 storage, normal files - you name it. You can open it as a remote data is locally and you stream it line by line, you can open a zipped file like it wasn't zipped. It's pretty much amazing! Check it out if you ever use Python (or get interested to port this to another language, that'd be cool)!

### 🎒 Why We Started Putting Unpopular Assets in Memory

This makes no sense coming from the title, it almost makes no sense at the end of the article. But it's very interesting and you get to learn things about how SSDs works and why this approach actually help Cloudflare saving costs. As I said, it barely makes sense but it does, a cool read!

### 🔀 The Webpage - The news paper on the web

Have you ever thought that it'd be cool to read news from the internet like they where from a newspaper? Russellsaw got you covered! This is an incredibly cool concept that the author created to scratch his itch from an idea he got one night. Check it out! Who knows, perhaps it'll be your new newspaper? ;)
