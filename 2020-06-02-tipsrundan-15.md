### 📈 A simple FAQ search engine in Swedish using fastText & Smooth Inverse Frequency

In this post a simple yet effective approach is laid out on how to unsupervised search a FAQ for the best answer on a custom request. It makes use of Word Embeddings to allow similar word to find similar words (cat / dog ~= pet) and embeds the sentences to find the nearest neighbour.

### 🔀 Obsidian - A knowledge base that works on local Markdown-files

'Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of
a local folder of plain text Markdown files.' - Obsidian is something I've tried out the last few days and am fond off. I really enjoy that it's based on raw MD so you can simply export the format by yourself and sync through git.

### 🔀 Chronopete - the 'Time Machine' for Linux

Cronopete is a Linux clone of Time Machine, the backup utility for Mac from Apple. It aims to mimic it as closely as possible. The looks are even the same! Maybe this is something to add when you set up the computer for your mom & dad at home. ;)
