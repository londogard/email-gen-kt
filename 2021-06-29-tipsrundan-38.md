###         Git Checkout, Git Push, Git Checkout, Wait What Branch Was It Again?

Lasse Heemann shared a small alias that might just make your life just a little bit easier.

`alias branches='git branch -v --sort=-committerdate | head -n 10'` 

In Lasses words:
> This is very practical when you jump between branches and _never_ remember the names of them

For those that prefer this can also be made into a `git-alias`, see more on [git-scm/alias](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases). 

And I couldn't agree more (except that I often end up using the shell history through `ctrl+r`)

And if you want to keep it extra fancy head over to [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5188364) to learn how to make it colorful and structured!

### [AFRY]  AFRY Innovation Day 2021 - when the dust settled

During our Innovation Week we had some really exciting projects created such as a 'ParkingApp' & classifying Magic Cards. All of this can be found on the Teams Channel, but for those that want a little bit more juice and a blog you can find it!

Read more about Scala 3.0 by Carl Ekeroth & Fredrik Strandin on [our blog](https://afry-south.github.io/new-features-in-scala3).     
Read more about how we managed to match resumes to assignment with ~completely unlabeled~ data, also on [our blog](https://afry-south.github.io/machine-learning/mix-match-cv/) with the demo [here](https://share.streamlit.io/afry-south/mix-match-cv/main/deployment.py).



### 🔀 Algorithm Competence: Escape Room

During the last competence evening we had an awesome time completing a Escape Room that was done programatically. It was really interesting how CodinGame had managed to puzzle it together (and how we solved it!). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7490199/123124991-6dcfc980-d448-11eb-85e7-4efb3111fe5f.png)



### 🔀 Brave Search

The new kid in town. Brave Search is unique on multiple fronts as in being kind to privacy (like DuckDuckGo), having its own index (DDG uses Bing), having a transparent and open ranking algorithm which will be open to community tweaking.  
It's really cool and can extract answers from StackOverflow and will in the future allow ad-free searching through a paid alternative.  
Over all I feel like this is a great chanse to break Googles kingdom of search and I'm happy to try it out.

### 🔀 Tech Writing by Google

Writing technical documents can be a bit of a hassle and requires a special mindset.    
To document things is easy, but to correctly put the user into the right mindset and to fully understand the whole ecosystem is another thing.

Learn a little more about how to sprinkle magic in your documentation and tech writing by Google.
