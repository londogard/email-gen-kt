###         Stop turning your computer off & on again by turning your graphics drivers off & on again!

From the previous Tipsrundan with Clipboard History, _Eric Lindeberg_ has another tool he's used for years achieving the same behaviour. Make sure to check out [CLCL](https://www.nakka.com/soft/clcl/index_eng.html) which Eric has enjoyed for a long time!

Experienced a complete computer-freeze? You might hear Roys (IT Crowd) voice telling you "have you tried turning it off and on again?".   
Well, it turns out you might not even need to restart the computer but simply the graphic drivers - and that's pretty simple.

**Windows:** `CTRL+SH+WIN+B`  
**Mac:** Change your resolution, this can easily be on a hotkey if you use [QuickRes](https://thnkdev.com/QuickRes/)
**Linux (gnome):** `ALT+F2` and enter the command `r` in the Command box.

### üéí Streamlit - A recommendation

Dennis Lond√∂g√•rd read into _streamlit_ and was very impressed by the ease of use and how backend + frontend is unified through simple scripting. Streamlit also allows you to achieve great caching through incredibly simple tools.

### [AFRY]  FREE Microsoft Certifications

<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/569l09.jpg" alt="badge" width="30%"/>
AFRY is a Microsoft Partner and have free certifications at Microsoft until the **last of June**.   
AI? Azure Pipelines? DevOps? Cloud Databases? Security? Microsft/Azure has something interesting for most out there.

So take this chance and **reach out to your manager about taking a certification**, it's the final "push" now!

### üîÄ Buffer Allocations that hurts your soul in secret ways

Every single program allocates memory. Byte buffers are at the core of many essential libraries which power the services the modern internet is built upon. If you‚Äôre building such a library, or even just copying data between different files, chances are you‚Äôll need to allocate a buffer.

In this post you'll learn the difference between `allocate` and `allocateDirect`. Both exists by a reason (on the JVM) and have some pretty interesting properties.

>Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don‚Äôt matter right now. Sometimes they matter later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know.

### üîÄ Compress much?

Wondering why your compression sucks? Want to learn what trade-offs that needs to be done depending on your requirements? Tuning for read? Write? Or even compression-ratio?  
The _quixdb_ "sqash compression benchmark" has you covered and also benchmarks multiple modes for the compression algorithms. P.S. `zstd` is currently my favourite, fight me over it!

### üîÄ Boston Dynamics builds an actual robot

I know most of you've been digging what Boston Dynamics has put out this far, from dogs to other things. But this time they might actually need some cash because they built something useful rather than impressing.   
The Verge goes through their new "Warehouse Logistics Stretch Robot".

### üîÄ Have you ever thought about winning financially by loosing financially?

This blog goes to depth on why it might make sense to actually play around with a cash flow and not win anything to later take it all. It's very detailed and lays out the thought process in a way that makes sense. I think I can say what he said took him years he solved in minutes for me, but perhaps I'll realise in a year I was wrong.
