### 🎒 piwheels: building a faster Python package repository for Raspberry Pi users

Ben Nuttall created an impressive repository that you'd make good in using on your Pi. I manually installed Numpy and it sure wasn't fun, by using this it's really fast as the Python Wheel is pre-built for the Pi! :D

### 👥 Everything I knew about reading was wrong

This title might sound clickbaty, but it's worth it. I think the ideas brought up, originally from Naval Ravikant, is brilliant. It's a new mindset that has helped me through the summer as I've tried to apply it. It feels a little bit like I finally get around to reading again!
