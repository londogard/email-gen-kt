### üìà Datastream for BigQuery

>Seamless replication from relational databases directly to BigQuery, enabling near real-time insights on operational data.

>git-bisect - Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug    
This is a really cool tool in `git` that I wasn't aware off which I learned through a friend of mine. Know any other cool git-commands that we should share with each-other? Please share!

Shared recently by Pontus W√§rnest√•l (InUse). It's an interesting article which brings forth studies that shows that Group Brainstorming is a waste of time.. Do you agree or not? Share on Slack!

>To grow and innovate, organizations have to come up with creative ideas. At the employee level, creativity results from a combination of expertise, motivation, and thinking skills. At the team level, it results from the synergy between team members, which allows the group to produce something greater than the sum of its parts.,
