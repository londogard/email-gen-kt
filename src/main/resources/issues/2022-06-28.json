Simply sign up, it’s free!  \nLet’s join forces and show AFRY’s face in the Data sphere of Malmö!",

      "description": "[Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/) has previously been recommended, and there exists some other Search Engines that are really cool too. \n\n1. [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) a paid really good and fast search engine\n2. [You](https://you.com/) a free really cool search engine which builds on a new layout. I never got used to it, but it’s interesting with the dense layout. A lot of people claim to enjoy it a lot!\n\nAnyhow, back to Brave they’ve now added _Goggles_ which allows you to add rules, filters and alter search rankings. This is really cool and seems to be close to what Kagi did with their Lenses.\n\nHow about a _Goggle_ that _Prioritize pages often used on ycombinator_? It’s possible and [exist](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart/blob/main/goggles/hacker_news.goggle).\n\nWanna learn more about the “_Goggle-language”_ to write your own? See [this](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart/blob/main/goggles/quickstart.goggle).\n\nAdding Goggles feels like a superpower!  \uD83E\uDDB8\u200D♂️",

      "description": "Optimizations? Machine Learning? Math? I’m drooling!\n\nApple has made some really impressive work by doing something that perhaps not most of us do, trying to find the simple wins.  \n\nThey spent some time on the math and neurons validating what types of optimizations could be done before moving it onto the Neural Chip on the iPhone. Their Transformer model compared to the baseline HuggingFace ended up having forward-passes, inference-mode only uses forward pass, that is 10x faster and peak-memory that is 14x lower on an iPhone 13.\n\nWhat’s even more interesting? They looked at power usage! On iPhone 13 they can optimize speed (3.47ms @ 0.454W) or battery (9.44ms @ 0.072W).  \n\nWanna learn more? Check the blog out!",
