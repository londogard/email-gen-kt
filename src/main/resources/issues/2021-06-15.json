    "description": "Oscar Carlsson has a great little 'hack' that will have your friends turn their head.  \nStart of by having a Web Browser, then open a new tab and paste the following\n\n`data:text/html, <html contenteditable>`\n\nThen open the page. This will **give you a editable blank area**. \uD83C\uDF89 And you'll certainly feel a bit like a hacker \uD83D\uDC68\u200D\uD83D\uDCBB.\n\nOn a more serious note this is seriously a _really_ good way to have a notepad ready to quickly alter text before moving it somewhere else.  \nOscar suggests that you add this as a bookmark to simplify the usage!"
