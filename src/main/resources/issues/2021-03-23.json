We did the full implementation from the first matrix multiplication to the last.   \nThe code is written in PyTorch and very simple to follow, with some demos at the end which you can train if you grab enough data & GPU-power to actually run it in a good manner (non-pretrained Transformers usually takes a few days of training on GPUs).   \nAnyhow, here's the full workshop in a ready-to-run in the cloud Jupyter Notebook!",
