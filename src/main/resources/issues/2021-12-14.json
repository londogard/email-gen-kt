    "description": "Do you need to restore files from staging in git?\n\nWe have `working directory`, `staging` and commited files if you've used `git add` and have something currently in `staging` and then do more changes.  \nThis is sometimes a bit \"blocking\" as you want to revert to what we had in  `staging` and you're not sure how...\n\nThat's when `git restore` comes to the rescue!\n\nThe description from git-scm.com:\n> Restore specified paths in the working tree with some contents from a restore source. If a path is tracked but does not exist in the restore source, it will be removed to match the source.\n> \n> The command can also be used to restore the content in the index with --staged, or restore both the working tree and the index with --staged --worktree.\n>\n> By default, if --staged is given, the contents are restored from HEAD, otherwise from the index. Use --source to restore from a different commit.\n\nFor more information head to [git-scm.com/docs/git-restore](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore)!"

      "description": "> TLDR: The zero-copy integration between DuckDB and Apache Arrow allows for rapid analysis of larger than memory datasets in Python and R using either SQL or relational APIs.\n\nA few of you have seen DuckDB mentioned previously, and there's a good reason as of why.  \nDuckDB is SQLite for columnar data. It's an amazing piece of technology.  \n\nFor those that are not aware of (Apache) Arrow it's a project that is a in-memory data format optimized for analytical libraries.  \nIt's blazing fast and can optimize column-data like crazy. Combining it with Parquet makes things even better..!  \n\nBy combining DuckDB and Arrow you get an amazing result that speaks for itself in terms of performance.  \nAllowing streaming data can reduce total peak memory by infinite essentially (0.3GB vs 248GB in example) and speed by magnitudes (showcasing benchmark with 11x-3000x faster depending on use-case and filter).\n\nMake sure to check this new zero-copy integration out!",
