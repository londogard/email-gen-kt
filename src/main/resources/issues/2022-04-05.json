    "description": "Tobias Olsson noted that Azure Pipelines has some issues, here's the following breakdown:\n\nHi! While trying to do a production release last Wednesday (March 30th) I got shutdown by Microsoft!\n    Deployment canceled by Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.ReleaseManagement\n\nAfter some expert googling I found out that: **_The windows-2016 environment is deprecated and will be removed on April 1st, 2022_**. Now I had to find out if we were using the windows 2016 version somewhere.\n\nI found out that we were using \"**Agent Specification: vs2017-win2016**\" on our release-pipeline, so now I had to change this to something that worked. \n\nThis link will explain a bit more about the changes to the agent: [Windows-2016 environment removal postponed until April 1st, 2022 · Issue #5238 · actions/virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/5238) \n\nBy using this link (with edits): https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_settings/agentqueues I found out which project were using the deprecated Agent.\n\nThis link shows how and what to change to: [Azure DevOps: Migrating to windows-latest](https://blog.novacare.no/devops-change-agent-specification-to-windows-latest/)\n\n**TL;DR; change it to \"windows-2022\"** - this will be the \"*windows-latest*\" as of March 6th."

Having spent the last 6+ years neck deep in SaaS companies and their metrics, it is something that I am constantly looking at to assess the health of a business. Three important things to consider when it comes to churn: what does it mean, why does it matter, and how to evaluate it.\nIt was very interesting learning about different churns, at least in my opinion! Essentially understanding the delicate differences in how to think.\n",
