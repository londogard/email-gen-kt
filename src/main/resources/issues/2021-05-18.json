    "description": "(Only MacOS users, sorry!)  \nPersonally I was for a long time annoyed by the incredibly bad Finder UI (\"explorer\" on MacOS) and how hard it is to actually walk quickly somewhere.   \nSome might respond '_use the terminal_' and I agree, but sometimes you just happen to end up in the GUI. An old colleague that's unfortunately not among us anymore (Zuzanna) showed me how to do this:  \n\n`cmd+sh+g` \n\nand the address bar will open up for you to paste a path.   \nP.S. if anyone wants a keybind for Windows it's `alt+d`.
