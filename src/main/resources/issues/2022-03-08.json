Protected KVM is optional and can be enabled on a per-VM basis, but for non-protected VMs, it looks like full KVM functionality is available.\n",

That is theoretical approaches also propose the same.\n\nTo allow failures means to allow new ways of thinking, being brave, and finding future paths.  \nTo not allow failures lead to a culture of silence, which will be a house of cards ready to fall any second. Like a domino brick pushed, donezo.\n\nStack Overflows blog goes deeper into this and how to build a space of reflection, safety and to be the best.\n\n> An introduction to psychological safety and ways to evaluate the level of safety in your organization.",
