      "description": "Taken from a twitter thread;\n\n1. Faster CPython, 10-60% faster and 25% on average compared to Python 3.10\n2. Error Handling\n\n- Better error messaging (showing exact location of error)\n- Grouped exceptions available!\n- Possible to add notes to an existing error throughÂ `e.add_note(<insert-note>)`Â \n\n4. Type Hints\n\n- Now has even better support\n- Variadic Generics!\n\n    ```python\n    Shape = TypeVarTuple('Shape')\n    Batch = NewType('Batch', int)\n    Channels = NewType('Channels', int)\n    \n    def add_batch_axis(x: Array[*Shape]) -> Array[Batch, *Shape]: ...\n    def del_batch_axis(x: Array[Batch, *Shape]) -> Array[*Shape]: ...\n    def add_batch_channels(\n      x: Array[*Shape]\n    ) -> Array[Batch, *Shape, Channels]: ...\n    \n    a: Array[Height, Width]\n    b = add_batch_axis(a)      # Inferred type is Array[Batch, Height, Width]\n    c = del_batch_axis(b)      # Array[Height, Width]\n    d = add_batch_channels(a)  # Array[Batch, Height, Width, Channels]\n    \n    ```",
