    "title": "GitHub Codespaces Publicly Available",
    "description": "Let's start by clarifying something:  \nGitHub Codespaces full version is only available for paying GitHub Teams (orgs) and GitHub Enterprise edition. \n\n**But**, we can use the free version which is a much simpler variant that excludes the environment. This means that you cannot run the code.  \nThen what's the point you might ask?  \nThe point is that we can edit our files and upload them to GitHub through a VS Code interface directly in the browser. No more pesky webUI that's annoying without a filesystem. \n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7490199/135758528-675abf2e-6bfb-4428-925d-bc6d901e9201.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n\n**How do I activate this mode?**\n\n1. Replace `github.com` with `github.dev` on your filepath in your repository\n2. When having a folder or file open in GitHub press `.` and the `github.dev` will open up with a VS Code GUI.\n\n_Pro-Tip_ if you want to take this a step further make sure to try out [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/) which gives 50h runtime freely."

I know _PopOS!_ got a vote or two. Got a favorite distro? Ping the #technical_discussions with your favorite!"
