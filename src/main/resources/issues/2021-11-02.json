    "description": "Fredrik Strandin shared a _supertips_ at the Smygehus-konferens two weeks ago.  \n**Citrix** is a tool that that allows you to log onto a standard computer (or pay for CAD). Putting it plain it's a remote \ncomputer inside the AFRY network. This can be very useful when you're blocked from some services. \n\nIt might lag a little using _Citrix Light_, but it works. Read more about Citrix [here](https://afonline.sharepoint.com/sites/VirtualWorkplace-Stage).\n\nYou can log onto the computers at [connect.afconsult.com](https://connect.afconsult.com/). The downloaded program might be a bit \nfaster than the light version in the browser."

Essentially it's used to validate diffs between large assets.\n\nDo you know about another good fast hash function? Share!",

It gets even more complicated on computers.  \nFirst off, we need to support Left-To-Right (LTR) and Right-To-Left (RTL) which is a beast in itself.  \nThen comes new characters, and finally the codes which produces these.\n\n> In short, from a native Japanese eye, yѳur ҭєxҭ lѳѳκs κιnd ѳf lικє ҭЋιs. This page will give you a brief description of the glyph appearance problems that often arise with implementations of Asian text display, why it happens, why it’s a big deal, and how to fix it.\n\nWhat is the problem then?  \nIn short all characters are represented by a digit, but some characters actually _share_ the same digit. This is really \nproblematic as you can guess.  \n\nIf you either want to learn more about this or actually get to know how to fix it, read the post below! \uD83D\uDC47",
