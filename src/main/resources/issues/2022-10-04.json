      "description": "The ones of us who enjoys writing Scala are most likely sad to hear about the license changes that Akka recently announced.  \n\nThe community has been fierce even if the licensing changes might make sense from a (lightbend’s) business perspective, and recently there’s been an initiative started to build a Open Source version of Akka named [Pekko](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/PekkoProposal) that’d reside under the Apache umbrella. Even with this initiative the future is unsure as first-movers advantage is a real thing and Pekko might simply slide into nothingness..\n\nWhat’s your opinion?",

What does it mean in practice though?  \nVirtual Threads leans close to _goroutines in golang_ which is near-zero-overhead threads.   \nWhy is it huge though? Because this update affect ALL current thread usage across the JVM. That means your old blocking API’s are now _much more efficient_.   \n  \nIs it only Java with it’s old blocking API that has gains to do? No, all new things like reactive approaches can tap into this power-source. So can Scala, Kotlin and more!",

Here’s one such case where a Indie-Developer almost reach a soul-crushing amount of work to keep their apps up-to-date with the rules and guidelines of App Store(s).\n\nIf an app is complete the maintenance should, in my opinion, be close-to-zero but that’s not the case. Apple and others keep pushing more and more work onto the developers and they’re not afraid to deactivate apps making it even harder to get back in the game.\n\nRead more about these problems in this great write-up!",
