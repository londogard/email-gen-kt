      "description": "> In 1978, Brian Eno released Ambient 1: Music for Airports, a landmark album in ambient and electronic music. Although it wasn‚Äôt the first ambient album, it was the first album to be explicitly labelled as ‚Äòambient music‚Äô. Music for Airports was a continuation of Brian Eno‚Äôs experimentation with the tape machine as a compositional tool, a process he‚Äôd begun three years prior with 1975‚Äôs Discreet Music...\n\nI think this blog proved very interesting!

      "description": "Python the language to hate or love.  \nYou might hate it, but most of us hate bash even more. Personally I see a great spot to use Python rather than bash for a multitude of automation.\n\nWhat better way than writing CLI:s?  \nGoogle's [`Python Fire`](https://github.com/google/python-fire) makes it _very simply_ to write CLI:s through Python. Excerpt from README:  \n> Python Fire is a library for automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs) from absolutely any Python object.\n\nSounds pretty darn amazing I'd say!\n\nHow about making it even more lit? \uD83D\uDD25  \nIntroducing [`Gooey`](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) which automagically turns CLI:s into user-friendly GUI:s. \nIt might not be the most beautiful you've ever seen, but through this tool you can magically turn your \"advanced\" CLI:s into \nsomething anyone at your office can use! \uD83D\uDE0D\n\n**Example:**  \n![CLI to GUI](https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyImages/raw/images/readme-images/1-0-4-title-card.png)\n",

And maybe even AWS?\n- Explore how many clusters you've got with a certain size\n\nThe cloud is a live database which makes it _very easy_ to keep lists of things which **don't get out of sync like that Excel sheet you've got**\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7490199/196105455-9e985b54-7978-4416-8971-3ca7150f03a3.png)",
