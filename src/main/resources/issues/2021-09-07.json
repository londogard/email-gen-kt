      "description": "> To get a cable like this, you used to need a million dollar budget or to find a guy named MG at DEFCON. But Hak5 teamed up with MG to allow more people access to this previously clandestine attack hardware. \n\nThis cable is really crazy and clearly shows how fas the world moves. To have this at a consumer-level price is crazy. We got a web-server, 802.11 radio and pretty good memory / cpu inside a friggin' usb cable!\n\nDo you know more about things like this?
