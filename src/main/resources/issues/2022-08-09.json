      "title": "Prune Once for All: Sparse Pre-Trained Language Models",
      "description": "Sparsity was once the name of the game. Old Natural Language Technology (NLP) techniques built upon very sparse data structures like Bag of Words, TF-IDF and others. Deep Learning turned this upside down by using dense structures to represent the intent/meaning rather than exact word. Even if the end-result is dense the path to the output is often not dense, as such this paper proposes a Sparsely trained Neural Network.",

      "description": "Optimizing simpel functions might seem like a stupid thing, but it can achieve two \"important things\":\n\n1. Incredibly fun and challenging\n2. Achieve incredible speedups as the function might be used pretty much everywhere\n\n> Here’s a fun bit of Monday optimization.  \n> DNS servers often have to convert DNS names to their canonical lower case form. BIND has to do so a bit more than most because it tries to preserve the case of DNS names rather than canonicalizing them."

      "description": "Still only know Transformers as the electrical engineering thingy?  \nIt's time to dust of the old books and get to know Transformers as the Deep Learning model that has impacted the world around us.\n\nThis blog is really fun and takes a interesting path to explain transformers in the way of Software Engineering rather than Data Science!"
