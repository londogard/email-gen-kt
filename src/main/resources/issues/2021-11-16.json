Paint was released the first time in 1985, and even with its updates it's pretty dated after all.  \n\nIntroducing [Excalidraw](http://excalidraw.com/)! Excalidraw is a really slick online \ndrawing-pad which enables you to draw shapes and text both in \"straight computerish\" manner and a \"hand-made\" one.\n![excalidraw image](https://pakstech.com/images/blog/2020/01/diagrams.png)\n\nExtending its usecase we got [Excalidec](https://excalideck.com/) which allows you to create a presentation from multiple \nExcalidraws, directly in the brower.  \nReally Excalidraw is smooth and I think the graphics give you a better feel!\n\nEnjoy drawing simple things again!  \nExtra Reading: [Why is Excalidraw so fucking good?](https://offbyone.us/posts/why-is-excalidraw-so-good).",
