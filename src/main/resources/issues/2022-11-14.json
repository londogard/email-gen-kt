In software, this kind of thing goes on all the time.**\n\nThis quote really stuck with me, it's perfect!",

While it holds true for the majority of workloads, we were reminded that performance of certain workloads running within JVMs can be affected not only by the design and implementation of the application code, but also by the implementation of the JVM itself.",
