In summary they are set to loose up towards $550 million and have to lay off 25% of the staff.  \nPredicting house prices 6 months in advance is a really tough problem which requires non-automatic system, which most likely was applied by Zillow. Trusting yourself too much, especially in times as covid, might hit back. Real hard.",

It is installed as just one executable file without any dependencies, provides a command-line interface, starts-up instantly, and works on macOS, Linux, and, yes, even Windows.\n> \n> See the source code [here](https://github.com/dainiusjocas/lucene-grep).  \n\nIn short `lmgrep` includes fancy stuffs like stemming, tokenization and much more to reduce the need of using a lot of regexps while grepping. For full-text search `lmgrep` will most likely be very helpful for you!  \nThe blog is indeed very interesting and 100% worth the read!",
