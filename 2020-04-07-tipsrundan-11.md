###  Learn how this Tipsrundan was generated from a JSON using Kotlin

### üë• 7 habits to become more productive

I think that this post has some really good points, especially the first. I'll summarize the 7 habits for the lazy readers: 1. Create a Daily To-Do List the Night Before, 2. Create Weekly Recurring Goals, 3. Physically Warm Up Before Working, 4. Read a Book Instead of Social Media, 5. Journaling, 6. Read the News of Your Interests, 7. Research Something Outside of Your Interests
