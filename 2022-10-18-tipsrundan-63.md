### 🔀 How Brian Eno Created Ambient 1: Music for Airports

> In 1978, Brian Eno released Ambient 1: Music for Airports, a landmark album in ambient and electronic music. Although it wasn’t the first ambient album, it was the first album to be explicitly labelled as ‘ambient music’. Music for Airports was a continuation of Brian Eno’s experimentation with the tape machine as a compositional tool, a process he’d begun three years prior with 1975’s Discreet Music...

I think this blog proved very interesting!

### 🔀 CLI, GUIs and more

Python the language to hate or love.    
You might hate it, but most of us hate bash even more. Personally I see a great spot to use Python rather than bash for a multitude of automation.

What better way than writing CLI:s?    
Google's [`Python Fire`](https://github.com/google/python-fire) makes it _very simply_ to write CLI:s through Python. Excerpt from README:    
> Python Fire is a library for automatically generating command line interfaces (CLIs) from absolutely any Python object.

Sounds pretty darn amazing I'd say!

How about making it even more lit? 🔥    
Introducing [`Gooey`](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) which automagically turns CLI:s into user-friendly GUI:s.   
It might not be the most beautiful you've ever seen, but through this tool you can magically turn your "advanced" CLI:s into   
something anyone at your office can use! 😍

### 🎒 Steampipe - "select * from cloud;"

I think that their introducing web-page is superb, and I ask of you to please check it out!

As a quick TL;DR  
- Query like it's 1992, yes SQL  
- Make it simple and elegant to query users  
  - Perhaps even finding users that have both Slack and Azure? And maybe even AWS?  
- Explore how many clusters you've got with a certain size

The cloud is a live database which makes it _very easy_ to keep lists of things which **don't get out of sync like that Excel sheet you've got**
