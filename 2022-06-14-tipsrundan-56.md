### 🔀 Flek - The fastest way to build Flutter apps in Python (Phoenix LiveView like)

Personally Phoenix LiveView seems like a really cool piece of technology but it's using Elixir ('Scala/F#' to Erlang) which I don't really have the time to invest in. Flek is a new framework that popped up this week which I think was really cool. It works a bit like LiveViews (which could be said to be similar to streamlit, but not really).

Interested in Websocket-updated fullstack frameworks where small pieces of HTML is updated rather than full page (like REST)? Check this out!

### 🔀 Apple 🚂 forward with the new M2 unveiling

The M1 chip released ~2 years ago was a unrivaled chip which still today is incredible in it's combination of power efficiency and raw power. Compiling code is really quick and battery goes on forever - it's a beast! It's now time for v2, the M2 chip, to debute. Apple revealed the new chipset and it's rather impressive and should make everyone pleased, especially the GPU-improvements!

### 🔀 Albert - Launcher on Linux (MacOS Spotlight equivalent)

As someone who partly uses MacOS I often miss the 'Spotlight' function on my other OS:es, Windows has a solution in store using [PowerToys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) and it's [_PowerToy Run_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run). For Linux it's a different story and the built-in solution on Ubuntu is not 100% there.

Got any other launcher? Share!

### 🔀 Is modern UX bad? Information density versus modern spacing. A throw at Spotify.

Neil brings up a discussion worthy of attention. Modern UI:s make things less dense, but is it really a good thing?  
Modern UX brings sleek looks that looks pretty and seems simple. Simple is not strictly equivalent with better though, sometimes information density is what wins because going through 50 menus gets too confusing (e.g. 'I had that option yesterday but cannot find it today').

Some newer approaches tends to add a command or omni-search option to make it faster to find things, but is that enough? What do you think about modern UI:s and their UX? Share on slack!
