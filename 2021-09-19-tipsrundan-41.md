###         Dorking your way through life

Dorking is the concept of searching for something _special_. 

Find on a specific site:
```bash
site:gumroad.com dynamodb
```

Find file type with something in the url and a special ending
```
site:.edu filetype:xls inurl:"email.xls"
```

A blog post with title?
```
inposttitle:"diy slime"
```

Want a coupon from a special site?
```
site:curology.com ("coupon" | "referral code" | "affiliate code" | "discount code" | "VIP")
```

### 🎒 Why don't you use Linux?

There's a slack thread on IT South which you should answer on!

### 🎒 Project Loom: On the Performance of User-Mode Threads and Coroutines

Ever heard of _Project Loom_? If you haven't you should most likely [read up on it](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~rpressler/loom/Loom-Proposal.html) if you're working on the JVM!

Ron Pressler talks us through coroutines & user-mode threads in a short technical post which is very interesting.  
In a way I'd wish for more content, but why don't we kick-off a discussion on the technical slack of AFRY IT South?

### 🔀 Why are hyperlinks blue?

The internet exists almost everywhere today, a lot of it being taken for granted. Have you ever noted the blue hyperlinks? Why are they blue?  
Personally I didn't know until Mozilla posted this interesting blog on how it came to be that hyperlinks are blue!
