###         What's New In Python?

Python 3 was launched in 2008, officially becoming the default language starting 2020.  
A lot of us know about most relevant changes in Python 3 like basic typing, multiprocesses, new utf-8 strings, print as a function, and much more.

But what has happened since? A lot. Pattern-Matching, simple Union Types, F-strings and much more!  
In [this blog](https://buitsyd.com/blog/2021/11/03/whats-new-in-python) by Hampus Londögård you'll learn the most essential parts!

###  Question of the Day: What is the best conference(s)?

Do you know about an awesome conference?  
I'm looking at creating the Conference List and I'm now trying to find the best ones!

Please make sure to share on Slack (#bu_competence) or email me (hampus.londogard@afry.com), with a short summary if possible!



### 🔀 Excalidraw, Excalideck & great painting!

Do you like to draw?  
Do you miss MS Paint on Linux and MacOS?  

Then [jspaint](https://jspaint.app/) is for you!  
...But do you wish to take it one step further? Paint was released the first time in 1985, and even with its updates it's pretty dated after all.  

Introducing [Excalidraw](http://excalidraw.com/)! Excalidraw is a really slick online 
drawing-pad which enables you to draw shapes and text both in "straight computerish" manner and a "hand-made" one.

Extending its usecase we got [Excalidec](https://excalideck.com/) which allows you to create a presentation from multiple 
Excalidraws, directly in the brower.  
Really Excalidraw is smooth and I think the graphics give you a better feel!

Enjoy drawing simple things again!
