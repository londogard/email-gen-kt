###         GitHub Codespaces Publicly Available

Let's start by clarifying something:  
GitHub Codespaces full version is only available for paying GitHub Teams (orgs) and GitHub Enterprise edition. 

**But**, we can use the free version which is a much simpler variant that excludes the environment. This means that you cannot run the code.  
Then what's the point you might ask?  
The point is that we can edit our files and upload them to GitHub through a VS Code interface directly in the browser. No more pesky webUI that's annoying without a filesystem.

**How do I activate this mode?**

1. Replace `github.com` with `github.dev` on your filepath in your repository
2. When having a folder or file open in GitHub press `.` and the `github.dev` will open up with a VS Code GUI.

_Pro-Tip_ if you want to take this a step further make sure to try out [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/) which gives 50h runtime freely.

###  Linux or not?

Last Tipsrundan I asked you all if you used Linux, and if not why?  
I'm happy to say that I got _a lot_ of answers, so thanks! ü•≥

So what are the reasons to, or not to, have Linux?

1. **Gaming** - This is the 1st reason to have Windows
2. **WSL** - WSL is pretty good today and allows you to game and develop

But a few of us are happy with the classical Dual-Booting, the main reasons being for fun 
or Deep Learning. I know _PopOS!_ got a vote or two. Got a favorite distro? Ping the #technical_discussions with your favorite!



### üéí 10x10% - Closing Emacs Bugs

It's _the 10th time_ that Lars closes 10% of all bugs in Emacs.  
Throughout this blog-post by the Emacs co-maintainer Lars goes through 
some of his goals and also gives some insightful **visualization** that I think 
a lot of us could make use of to show leadership more clearly 
what is happening.

It's also rather interesting following his thoughts and thinking further 
about bug-squashing (maintenance).

### üéí Why we (Gitlab) spent the last month eliminating PostgreSQL subtransactions

Gitlab noticed that the database of Gitlab.com would stall for minutes sometimes, giving users the error-message 500.  
‚ö†Ô∏èNot good‚ö†Ô∏è  
Through a long debugging they found that it was a `SAVEPOINT SQL Query` that was the root cause.

What is a `SAVEPOINT`? Why did this impact? How do we fix it?

### üîÄ Waydroid

Simply put this is a new way to run Android on Linux, by their own words:

>A container-based approach to boot a full Android system on a regular GNU/Linux system like Ubuntu.

Have you used Waydroid? Or another emulator/virtualization tech? Let us know more about your experiences on slack in [#technical-discussions](https://buitsouth.slack.com/archives/C019L2218Q6)!

### üîÄ Sustainable ‚òï on a new level

This news made me really excited - a Finnish company has successfully created lab-grown coffee.  

Personally I believe that one of multiple things that needs to accelerate for us to 
put a brake on the environmental impact is lab-grown groceries.  
Coffee is a great step forward which shows us the possibilities.
