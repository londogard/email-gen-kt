## Supertipset üí°
###         Citrix - be at AFRY from home

Fredrik Strandin shared a _supertips_ at the Smygehus-konferens two weeks ago.  
**Citrix** is a tool that that allows you to log onto a standard computer (or pay for CAD). Putting it plain it's a remote 
computer inside the AFRY network. This can be very useful when you're blocked from some services. 

It might lag a little using _Citrix Light_, but it works. Read more about Citrix [here](https://afonline.sharepoint.com/sites/VirtualWorkplace-Stage).

You can log onto the computers at [connect.afconsult.com](https://connect.afconsult.com/). The downloaded program might be a bit 
faster than the light version in the browser.

### üîÄ Meow Hash

The Meow hash is a high-speed hash function named after the character Meow in [Meow the Infinite](https://meowtheinfinite.com/).  

A nicely written article that takes you through the story of how mollyrocket created a incredibly 
fast hash that is not cryptographic. Essentially it's used to validate diffs between large assets.

Do you know about another good fast hash function? Share!

### üîÄ Unicodes, Japanese and all hell breaks loose

Languages and letters are complicated. It gets even more complicated on computers.  
First off, we need to support Left-To-Right (LTR) and Right-To-Left (RTL) which is a beast in itself.  
Then comes new characters, and finally the codes which produces these.

> In short, from a native Japanese eye, y—≥ur “≠—îx“≠ l—≥—≥Œ∫s Œ∫Œπnd —≥f lŒπŒ∫—î “≠–ãŒπs. This page will give you a brief description of the glyph appearance problems that often arise with implementations of Asian text display, why it happens, why it‚Äôs a big deal, and how to fix it.

What is the problem then?  
In short all characters are represented by a digit, but some characters actually _share_ the same digit. This is really 
problematic as you can guess.  

If you either want to learn more about this or actually get to know how to fix it, read the post below! üëá

### üì± Why hooks are the best thing to happen to React

Anyone even remotely interested in frontend and React should take a look at this, unless you're intermediate experienced in React, and realize a few things:
1. What are React Hooks?
2. Why do they matter?
3. How can they help me?

React Hooks are the 'new' way of writing React-code.

Over all a good blog brought by Stack Overflow.

### üîÄ Android‚Ñ¢ apps on Windows 11

Windows is going headstrong into the 'Subsystem' space and are now announcing Android Apps for their latest OS (Windows 11).  
On top of this new Subsystem for Android Windows actually added default CUDA support for WSL2 in Windows 11 which is a reason to upgrade, no more dev-builds!

### üì± Smart CSS Solutions For Common UI Challenges

As a 'non-frontender' I found this post refreshing, seeing new optimized CSS that's now available.

>It‚Äôs incredible to see what we can do with CSS today, especially if you still remember how difficult it once was to figure out stacking contexts or why margins collapsed and why top: float didn‚Äôt work. In this post, we‚Äôll look at just that: **exciting and fun things we can do with CSS**, exploring common problems and use cases we all have to face in our work.
