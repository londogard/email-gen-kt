### 🔀 What is the Difference between px, rem and em?

In CSS you can find different units of measurement for all the elements that make up a document <html> the most used by all are the px , however there are many more as explained in MDN. This time We are going to focus on the main differences between absolute units and relative units em and rem .

The absolute units do not change in size, while the relative units change according to the font size of the parent element.

### 🔀 2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses

Johan Hallenberg recommends: Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses list (CWE™ Top 25)

>This list demonstrates the currently most common and impactful software weaknesses. Often easy to find and exploit, these can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to completely take over a system, steal data, or prevent applications from working.

### 🔀 The Architecture of Open Source Applications

Johan Hallenberg recommends: The Architecture of Open Source Applications.

 > Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.

### 🔀 Sapling: A Scalable, User-Friendly Source Control System

Meta has built a new VCS that is integrated with git.    
I think it's a cool endeavour they're starting and I wish them luck! A cleaner API that is more intuitive than git is dearly needed! 🤓
