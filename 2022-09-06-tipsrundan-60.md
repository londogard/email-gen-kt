### 👥 Why are you so busy?

I'll start this article with the conclusion,    
> You and your team should never be so busy that you can't do your job properly or that you begin to hate your work. Especially if you're a leader or a leader-of-leaders, then you should actually (yes you should, I'll die on this hill) have free time to think alone, and to talk and ideate organically with peers. Contrary to popular belief: back-to-back meetings isn't a badge of honour, it's a red flag.

If you wanna learn more about why being to busy to do work is absurd make sure to read this great article

### 🎒 Performance Improvements in .NET 7

.NET have these blogs with each release now, and I love it! 😍    
.NET 7 is nothing short of impressive, it seems they include a opponent of the JVMs GraalVM.    
More than 1000 PRs related to performance (which might tell us a different story, but it's a immensely large project ).    
JIT improvements, AOT compilation, better JSON-serializarion & much more!  
Simple things like sum & loops is multiple times faster, which ends up affecting s large part of your code-base.

Do you enjoy benchmarks, diving into de-compiled code etc? This is certainly for you then! 🤓

Jonas seems to be a great person, he does things because it's fun and enjoyable. Why not rewrite your own blog into Rust (or any language)?
